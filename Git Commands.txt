21. IN ORDER TO IGNORE A FILE FROM ADDING INTO YOU GIT REPOSITORY.

      -> First we need to make a '.gitignore' file using 'touch .gitignore'

      ->  Now suppose we want to ignore 'logs.txt' file from being added into the repository,
          it doesn't matter weather the file is inside a folder(every exsistance of the file will be ignored)

      -> For this we simply need to add or file into the '.gitignore' file and thats it.

      -> Now if we want to ignore all the files with extension '.txt' we need to add '*.txt'
         into the '.gitignore'.
    
      -> Now if we only want to ignore that instance of the file 'logs.txt' which is present
         inside the '.gitignore' and all the rest instances or copies of this file will be added into the git repository,
         then in that case we need to write '/logs.txt' in the '.gitignore'.
